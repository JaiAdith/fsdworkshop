## Database Schema

### User Collection
- Personal information (name, email, phone, date of birth)
- Authentication data (hashed password, role)
- License information
- Address details
- Account metadata (creation date, verification status)

### Car Collection
- Vehicle identification (brand, model, year, license plate)
- Specifications (category, fuel type, transmission, seats)
- Pricing and availability information
- Location and features
- Images and descriptions

### Booking Collection
- User and car references
- Rental period (start/end dates)
- Pricing information (days, total amount)
- Status tracking (pending, confirmed, active, completed, cancelled)
- Location details (pickup/dropoff)
- Additional information (special requests, damage reports)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes
- `POST /api/users/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile (protected)
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile (protected)

### Car Routes
- `GET /api/cars` - Get all cars with optional filtering
- `GET /api/cars/:id` - Get specific car details
- `GET /api/cars/search` - Search cars by query
- `POST /api/cars` - Create new car (admin only)
- `PUT /api/cars/:id` - Update car (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/cars/:id` - Delete car (admin only)

### Booking Routes
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking (protected)
- `GET /api/bookings/my-bookings` - Get user's bookings (protected)
- `GET /api/bookings` - Get all bookings (admin only)
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Get specific booking (protected)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancel booking (protected)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status` - Update booking status (admin only)

## State Management

### Zustand Stores

**Car Store (`carStore.js`)**
- Manages car listings and search results
- Handles car CRUD operations
- Manages loading states and errors

**User Store (`userStore.js`)**
- Handles authentication state
- Manages user profile information
- Persists login state across sessions

**Booking Store (`bookingStore.js`)**
- Manages user bookings
- Handles booking creation and cancellation
- Tracks booking status updates

## Key Technical Decisions

### Frontend
- **Chakra UI**: Chosen for rapid development and consistent design
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management, simpler than Redux
- **React Router**: Standard routing solution for React applications
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with excellent development experience

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Minimal and flexible Node.js framework
- **MongoDB/Mongoose**: NoSQL database with excellent JavaScript integration
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication perfect for distributed systems
- **bcryptjs**: Industry-standard password hashing

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- JWT token-based authentication
- Protected API routes with middleware
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

## Getting Started for Development

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js (v16+), MongoDB
2. **Setup**: Run `./setup.sh` or follow manual installation steps
3. **Environment**: Configure `.env` file with database and JWT settings
4. **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start both frontend and backend
5. **Testing**: Access application at http://localhost:5173

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
